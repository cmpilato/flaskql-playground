MongoDB+Flask+Graphene Docker Playground

## How-To

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `docker-compose up -d --build`
3.  Visit http://localhost:5000/graphql

## Acknowledgements

This began as a Dockerized form of the Graphene Flask example found at
https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-mongo/.  It required some
minor local modifications to make it run, but let's give credit where
it's due, shall we?
